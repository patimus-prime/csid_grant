  abstract = {Abstract             Predicting the effects of coding variants is a major challenge. While recent deep-learning models have improved variant effect prediction accuracy, they cannot analyze all coding variants due to dependency on close homologs or software limitations. Here we developed a workflow using ESM1b, a 650-million-parameter protein language model, to predict all \textasciitilde 450 million possible missense variant effects in the human genome, and made all predictions available on a web portal. ESM1b outperformed existing methods in classifying \textasciitilde 150,000 ClinVar/HGMD missense variants as pathogenic or benign and predicting measurements across 28 deep mutational scan datasets. We further annotated \textasciitilde 2 million variants as damaging only in specific protein isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms when predicting variant effects. Our approach also generalizes to more complex coding variants such as in-frame indels and stop-gains. Together, these results establish protein language models as an effective, accurate and general approach to predicting variant effects.},

  abstract = {Recent attempts at utilizing deep learning for structure-based virtual screening have focused on training models to predict binding affinity from protein-ligand complexes with known crystal structures. The PDBbind dataset is the current standard for training such models, but its small size (less than 20K binding affinity measurements) leads to models failing to generalize to new targets, and model performance is typically on par with those trained with only ligand information. The CrossDocked dataset expands binding pose data for protein-ligand complexes but does not introduce new affinity data. ChEMBL, on the other hand, contains a wealth of binding affinity information but contains no information about the binding poses. We introduce BigBind, a dataset that maps ChEMBL activity data to protein targets from CrossDocked. This dataset comprises 851K ligand binding affinities and 3D pocket structures. After augmenting this dataset with an equal number of putative inactives for each target, we train BANANA (BAsic NeurAl Network for binding Affinity) to classify actives from inactives. The resulting model achieved an AUC of 0.72 on BigBind's test set, while a ligand-only model achieved an AUC of 0.64. Our model achieves competitive performance on the LIT-PCBA benchmark (median EF1\% 2.06) while running 16,000 times faster than molecular docking with GNINA. Notably, we achieve a state-of-the-art EF1\% of 4.95 when we use BANANA to filter out 90\% of the compounds prior to docking with GNINA. We hope that BANANA and future models trained on this dataset will prove useful for prospective virtual screening tasks.},

We parameterize a simple scoring function on the fly and use L-BFGS minimization to optimize an initially random ligand pose. Using rigorous benchmarking practices, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while running ten times faster than the next-best method.

Recent deep learning methods that treat docking as a regression problem have decreased runtime compared to traditional search-based methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38\% top-1 success rate (RMSD{$<$}2A) on PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23\%) and deep learning (20\%) methods. Moreover, while previous methods are not able to dock on computationally folded structures (maximum accuracy 10.4\%), DiffDock maintains significantly higher precision (21.7\%). Finally, DiffDock has fast inference times and provides confidence estimates with high selective accuracy.},

No congenital deficiency has been described for maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM). Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed for the pathogenic variants CLD, CSD, and CTD and the articles retrieved were analyzed to estimate the prevalence of congenital disaccharidase deficiencies. Results: Based on reported variants, the estimated prevalence was 1.3 per 106 births (95\% CI: 1.1-1.7) for CLD, and 31.4 per 106 births (95\% CI: 28.3-34.8) for CSD. Using data on previously reported variants and variants predicted to be loss-of-function in gnomAD, the overall estimated prevalence was 2.3 per 106 births (95\% CI: 1.9-2.9) for CLD, 57.6 per 106 births (95\% CI:52.5-63.2) for CSD, and 9.2 per 106 births (95\% CI: 2.5 -3.7) for CTD. Conclusion: The prevalence of CSD was found to be relatively high, while for other congenital disaccharidase deficiencies, the estimated prevalence was very low. \textcopyright{} 2022 French Society of Pediatrics.

A 23-year-old patient was referred with a diagnosis of IBS due to his long-standing postprandial diarrhoea associated with bloating, abdominal pain and nausea. He also had marked fatigue, headaches and mouth ulcers. He had symptoms since infancy without signs of malnutrition or failure-to-thrive. Extensive investigations excluded alternate causes of diarrhoea, including coeliac and inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and bile acid diarrhoea. A low FODMAP diet worsened symptoms and psychological interventions were not helpful. We hypothesised the involvement of SI defects.

The diagnosis of congenital diarrheal disorders like CSID is difficult due to unspecific symptoms and usually requires invasive biopsy sampling of the intestine. Sequencing of the SI gene and molecular analysis of the resulting potentially pathogenic SI protein variants may facilitate a diagnosis in the future. This study aimed to categorize SI mutations based on their functional consequences. Methods cDNAs encoding 13 SI mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. The molecular pathogenicity of the resulting SI mutants was defined by analyzing their biosynthesis, cellular localization, structure and enzymatic functions. Results Three biosynthetic phenotypes for the novel SI mutations were identified. The first biosynthetic phenotype was defined by mutants that are intracellularly transported in a fashion similar to wild type SI and with normal, but varying, levels of enzymatic activity. The second biosynthetic phenotype was defined by mutants with delayed maturation and trafficking kinetics and reduced activity. The third group of mutants is entirely transport incompetent and functionally inactive. Conclusions The current study unraveled CSID as a multifaceted malabsorption disorder that comprises three major classes of functional and trafficking mutants of SI and established a gradient of mild to severe functional deficits in the enzymatic functions of the enzyme. General significance This novel concept and the existence of mild consequences in a number of SI mutants strongly propose that CSID is an underdiagnosed and a more common intestinal disease than currently known.},

In most cases, genetics may be the key for precise diagnosis. We present an infant girl with chronic congenital diarrhea that resolved after introduction of fructose-based formula but had no identified mutation in the SLC5A1 gene. Using whole exome sequencing (WES) we identified other mutations that better dictated dietary adjustments. Methods: WES of the patient and her parents was performed. The analysis focused on recessive model including compound heterozygous mutations. Sanger sequencing was used to validate identified mutations and to screen the patient's newborn sister and grandparents. Expression and localization analysis were performed in the patient's duodenal biopsies using immunohistochemistry. Results: Using WES we identified a new compound heterozygote mutation in sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene; a maternal inherited known V577G mutation, and a novel paternal inherited C1531W mutation. Importantly, the newborn offspring carried similar compound heterozygous mutations. Computational predictions suggest that both mutations highly destabilize the protein. SI expression and localization studies determined that the mutated SI protein was not expressed on the brush border membrane in the patient's duodenal biopsies, verifying the diagnosis of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). Conclusions: The novel compound heterozygote V577G/C1531W SI mutations lead to lack of SI expression in the duodenal brush border, confirming the diagnosis of CSID. These cases of CSID extend the molecular spectrum of this condition, further directing a more adequate dietary intervention for the patient and newborn sibling.},

Congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a rare genetic form of disaccharide malabsorption characterised by diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating, which are features common to IBS. We tested sucrase\textendash isomaltase (SI) gene variants for their potential relevance in IBS. Design We sequenced SI exons in seven familial cases, and screened four CSID mutations (p.Val557Gly, p.Gly1073Asp, p.Arg1124Ter and p.Phe1745Cys) and a common SI coding polymorphism (p.Val15Phe) in a multicentre cohort of 1887 cases and controls. We studied the effect of the 15Val to 15Phe substitution on SI function in vitro. We analysed p.Val15Phe genotype in relation to IBS status, stool frequency and faecal microbiota composition in 250 individuals from the general population. Results CSID mutations were more common in patients than asymptomatic controls (p=0.074; OR=1.84) and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference sequenced individuals (p=0.020; OR=1.57). 15Phe was detected in 6/7 sequenced familial cases, and increased IBS risk in case\textendash control and population-based cohorts, with best evidence for diarrhoea phenotypes (combined p=0.00012; OR=1.36). In the population-based sample, 15Phe allele dosage correlated with stool frequency (p=0.026) and Parabacteroides faecal microbiota abundance (p=0.0024). The SI protein with 15Phe exhibited 35\% reduced enzymatic activity in vitro compared with 15Val (p{$<$}0.05). Conclusions SI gene variants coding for disaccharidases with defective or reduced enzymatic activity predispose to IBS. This may help the identification of individuals at risk, and contribute to personalising treatment options in a subset of patients.},

Interestingly, the main symptoms of CSID overlap with those in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional gastrointestinal disorder with unknown etiology. Recent advances in genetic screening of IBS patients have revealed rare SI gene variants that are associated with IBS. Here, we investigated the biochemical, cellular and functional phenotypes of several of these variants. The data demonstrate that the SI mutants can be categorized into three groups including immature, mature but slowly transported, and finally mature and properly transported but with reduced enzymatic activity. We also identified SI mutant phenotypes that are deficient but generally not as severe as those characterized in CSID patients. The variable effects on the trafficking and function of the mutations analyzed in this study support the view that both CSID and IBS are heterogeneous disorders, the severity of which is likely related to the biochemical phenotypes of the SI mutants as well as the environment and diet of patients. Our study underlines the necessity to screen for SI mutations in IBS patients and to consider enzyme replacement therapy as an appropriate therapy as in CSID.},

SI, together with maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM), belongs to the enzyme family of disaccharidases required for breakdown of {$\alpha$}-glycosidic linkages in the small intestine. The effects of homozygote and compound heterozygote inheritance trait of SI mutations in CSID patients have been well described in former studies. Here we propose the inclusion of heterozygote mutation carriers as a new entity in CSID, possibly presenting with milder symptoms. The hypothesis is supported by recent observations of heterozygote mutation carriers among patients suffering from CSID or patients diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Recent studies implicate significant phenotypic heterogeneity depending on the character of the mutation and call for more research regarding the correlation of genetics, function at the cellular and molecular level and clinical presentation. The increased importance of SI gene variants in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other functional gastrointestinal disorders FGIDs and their available symptom relief diets like fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols FODMAPs suggest that the heterozygote mutants may affect the disease development and treatment.},

  abstract = {Understanding how proteins structurally interact is crucial to modern biology, with applications in drug discovery and protein design. Recent machine learning methods have formulated protein-small molecule docking as a generative problem with significant performance boosts over both traditional and deep learning baselines. In this work, we propose a similar approach for rigid protein-protein docking: DiffDock-PP is a diffusion generative model that learns to translate and rotate unbound protein structures into their bound conformations. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on DIPS with a median C-RMSD of 4.85, outperforming all considered baselines. Additionally, DiffDock-PP is faster than all search-based methods and generates reliable confidence estimates for its predictions.

Lactose intolerance is a well-established carbohydrate malabsorption syndrome that causes symptoms similar to IBS such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, the prevalence of sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (SID) in this population is poorly defined. SID is a condition in which sucrase-isomaltase, an enzyme produced by brush border of small intestine to metabolize sucrose, is deficient. Just like lactase deficiency, SID causes symptoms of maldigestion syndromes including abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of SID in patients with presumed IBS-D/M and characterize its clinical presentation.},

  abstract = {Background: Congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency is a rare hereditary cause of chronic diarrhea in children. People with this condition lack the intestinal brush-border enzyme required for digestion of di- and oligosaccharides, including sucrose and isomaltose, leading to malabsorption. Although the condition is known to be highly prevalent (about 5\%\textendash 10\%) in several Inuit populations, the genetic basis for this has not been described. We sought to identify a common mutation for congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency in the Inuit population. Methods: We sequenced the sucrase\textendash isomaltase gene, SI, in a single Inuit proband with congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency who had severe fermentative diarrhea and failure to thrive. We then genotyped a further 128 anonymized Inuit controls from a variety of locales in the Canadian Arctic to assess for a possible founder effect. Results: In the proband, we identified a novel, homozygous frameshift mutation, c.273\_274delAG (p.Gly92Leufs*8), predicted to result in complete absence of a functional protein product. This change was very common among the Inuit controls, with an observed allele frequency of 17.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 12.6\%\textendash 21.8\%). The predicted Hardy\textendash Weinberg prevalence of congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency in Inuit people, based on this single founder allele, is 3.0\% (95\% CI 1.4\%\textendash 4.5\%), which is comparable with previous estimates. Interpretation: We found a common mutation, SI c.273\_274delAG, to be responsible for the high prevalence of congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency among Inuit people. Targeted mutation testing for this allele should afford a simple and minimally invasive means of diagnosing this condition in Inuit patients with chronic diarrhea.},

While the prevalence of CSID is high in the indigenous populations of Alaska and Greenland, it is imprecise and ambiguous in the Turkish pediatric population. In this cross-sectional case\textendash control study, which is retrospective in nature, next-generation sequencing (NGS) results obtained from records of 94 pediatric patients with chronic nonspecific diarrhea were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and treatment responses of those diagnosed with CSID were evaluated. We identified one new, homozygous frame-shift mutation and 10 other heterozygous mutations. Two cases were from the same family and nine were from different families. While the median age at onset of symptoms was 6 months (0\textendash 12), median age at diagnosis was 60 months (18\textendash 192) with a median delay of 5 years and 5 months (10 months -15 years and 5 months) in diagnosis. Clinical symptoms included diarrhea (100\%), abdominal pain (54.5\%), vomiting after consuming sucrose (27.2\%), diaper dermatitis (36.3\%) and growth retardation (81\%). Our clinical study revealed that sucrase-isomaltase deficiency may have been underdiagnosed in patients with chronic diarrhea in Turkey. In addition, the frequency of heterozygous mutation carriers was significantly higher than that of homozygous mutation carriers and those with a heterozygous mutations responded well to the treatment.},

The first study consisted of data on 399 persons (339 whites, 53 blacks, and 7 American Indians) ages 1 month to 93 years, with normal intestinal histology. Among whites, all 117 children 5 years old or under had high lactase levels, whereas low levels were found only in subjects over 5 years of age. No low lactase levels were identified among the 11 black children 3 years old or under, but in comparison to coetaneous white children, their mean lactase activity was signficantly less. The majority of older blacks had low lactases. In whites and blacks alpha-disaccharidases did not participate in the age-related changes demonstrated with lactase. Of the 7 American Indians, none under 26 months old had low lactase levels, whereas the 4 over 10 years old had low activities. Heterozygotes for sucrase-isomaltase deficiency were identified only among whites. Low lactase levels developed during childhood in all races studied, however, many for unknown reasons maintained their lactose tolerance until adulthood. In the second study of 13 additional children with secondary disaccharidase deficiencies, emergence of a primary low lactase was related to age and race, rather than to mucosal damage. It appears that primary low intestinal lactase levels are absent or rare in whites under 5 and blacks under 3 years of age, and the deficiency is not related to mucosal damage.},

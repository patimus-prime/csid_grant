  abstract = {Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) is used to estimate the number of homozygous and heterozygous variant carriers based on its allele frequency in populations that are not evolving. Deviations from HWE in large population databases have been used to detect genotyping errors, which can result in extreme heterozygote excess (HetExc). However, HetExc might also be a sign of natural selection since recessive disease causing variants should occur less frequently in a homozygous state in the population, but may reach high allele frequency in a heterozygous state, especially if they are advantageous. We developed a filtering strategy to detect these variants and applied it on genome data from 137,842 individuals. The main limitations of this approach were quality of genotype calls and insufficient population sizes, whereas population structure and inbreeding can reduce sensitivity, but not precision, in certain populations. Nevertheless, we identified 161 HetExc variants in 149 genes, most of which were specific to African/African American populations ({$\sim$}79.5\%). Although the majority of them were not associated with known diseases, or were classified as clinically ``benign,'' they were enriched in genes associated with autosomal recessive diseases. The resulting dataset also contained two known recessive disease causing variants with evidence of heterozygote advantage in the sickle-cell anemia (HBB) and cystic fibrosis (CFTR). Finally, we provide supporting in silico evidence of a novel heterozygote advantageous variant in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 6 gene (CHD6; involved in influenza virus replication). We anticipate that our approach will aid the detection of rare recessive disease causing variants in the future.},

While recent deep-learning models have improved variant effect prediction accuracy, they cannot analyze all coding variants due to dependency on close homologs or software limitations. Here we developed a workflow using ESM1b, a 650-million-parameter protein language model, to predict all \textasciitilde 450 million possible missense variant effects in the human genome, and made all predictions available on a web portal. ESM1b outperformed existing methods in classifying \textasciitilde 150,000 ClinVar/HGMD missense variants as pathogenic or benign and predicting measurements across 28 deep mutational scan datasets. We further annotated \textasciitilde 2 million variants as damaging only in specific protein isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms when predicting variant effects. Our approach also generalizes to more complex coding variants such as in-frame indels and stop-gains. Together, these results establish protein language models as an effective, accurate and general approach to predicting variant effects.},

The PDBbind dataset is the current standard for training such models, but its small size (less than 20K binding affinity measurements) leads to models failing to generalize to new targets, and model performance is typically on par with those trained with only ligand information. The CrossDocked dataset expands binding pose data for protein-ligand complexes but does not introduce new affinity data. ChEMBL, on the other hand, contains a wealth of binding affinity information but contains no information about the binding poses. We introduce BigBind, a dataset that maps ChEMBL activity data to protein targets from CrossDocked. This dataset comprises 851K ligand binding affinities and 3D pocket structures. After augmenting this dataset with an equal number of putative inactives for each target, we train BANANA (BAsic NeurAl Network for binding Affinity) to classify actives from inactives. The resulting model achieved an AUC of 0.72 on BigBind's test set, while a ligand-only model achieved an AUC of 0.64. Our model achieves competitive performance on the LIT-PCBA benchmark (median EF1\% 2.06) while running 16,000 times faster than molecular docking with GNINA. Notably, we achieve a state-of-the-art EF1\% of 4.95 when we use BANANA to filter out 90\% of the compounds prior to docking with GNINA. We hope that BANANA and future models trained on this dataset will prove useful for prospective virtual screening tasks.},

  abstract = {The depletion of disruptive variation caused by purifying natural selection (constraint) has been widely used to investigate protein-coding genes underlying human disorders, but attempts to assess constraint for non-protein-coding regions have proven more difficult. Here we aggregate, process, and release a dataset of 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), the largest public open-access human genome reference dataset, and use this dataset to build a mutational constraint map for the whole genome. We present a refined mutational model that incorporates local sequence context and regional genomic features to detect depletions of variation across the genome. As expected, proteincoding sequences overall are under stronger constraint than non-coding regions. Within the non-coding genome, constrained regions are enriched for known regulatory elements and variants implicated in complex human diseases and traits, facilitating the triangulation of biological annotation, disease association, and natural selection to non-coding DNA analysis. More constrained regulatory elements tend to regulate more constrained protein-coding genes, while non-coding constraint captures additional functional information underrecognized by gene constraint metrics. We demonstrate that this genome-wide constraint map provides an effective approach for characterizing the non-coding genome and improving the identification and interpretation of functional human genetic variation.},

Recent deep learning methods that treat docking as a regression problem have decreased runtime compared to traditional search-based methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38\% top-1 success rate (RMSD{$<$}2A) on PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23\%) and deep learning (20\%) methods. Moreover, while previous methods are not able to dock on computationally folded structures (maximum accuracy 10.4\%), DiffDock maintains significantly higher precision (21.7\%). Finally, DiffDock has fast inference times and provides confidence estimates with high selective accuracy.},

No congenital deficiency has been described for maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM). Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed for the pathogenic variants CLD, CSD, and CTD and the articles retrieved were analyzed to estimate the prevalence of congenital disaccharidase deficiencies. Results: Based on reported variants, the estimated prevalence was 1.3 per 106 births (95\% CI: 1.1-1.7) for CLD, and 31.4 per 106 births (95\% CI: 28.3-34.8) for CSD. Using data on previously reported variants and variants predicted to be loss-of-function in gnomAD, the overall estimated prevalence was 2.3 per 106 births (95\% CI: 1.9-2.9) for CLD, 57.6 per 106 births (95\% CI:52.5-63.2) for CSD, and 9.2 per 106 births (95\% CI: 2.5 -3.7) for CTD. Conclusion: The prevalence of CSD was found to be relatively high, while for other congenital disaccharidase deficiencies, the estimated prevalence was very low. \textcopyright{} 2022 French Society of Pediatrics.

In view of the lack of this information on Canadian Eskimos, their gradual abandonment of traditional diets, and the growing popularity of school nutrition programs in the Canadian Arctic, residents of two Canadian Inuit settlements were screened for disaccharide malabsorption. Forty-three (73\%) of 59 Inuit, 2.5 to 57 years old, were unable to absorb a lactose load of 2 g/kg, maximum 50 g. All but three of the malabsorbers had clinical symptoms of lactose intolerance. Eight of the 43 malabsorbers claimed to be milk intolerant. It appeared that lactase activity declined between ages 4 and 8 in this population. Four of 56 (7\%) were unable to absorb the sucrose test load. More than half of the subjects reported daily consumption of soft drinks and candy. Most foods consumed were still indigenous meat or fish and cereal products. Vegetables and fruit were generally not eaten, and very little milk was consumed other than that used as whitener with coffee or tea and that received at the elementary school. Since sources of calcium and vitamin D are limited, school milk programs may be prudent. However, lactose-hydrolyzed milk should be available to school children who are milk intolerant. Nutrition education should also be an integral part of school feeding programs, particularly for a population in cultural transition.},

A 23-year-old patient was referred with a diagnosis of IBS due to his long-standing postprandial diarrhoea associated with bloating, abdominal pain and nausea. He also had marked fatigue, headaches and mouth ulcers. He had symptoms since infancy without signs of malnutrition or failure-to-thrive. Extensive investigations excluded alternate causes of diarrhoea, including coeliac and inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and bile acid diarrhoea. A low FODMAP diet worsened symptoms and psychological interventions were not helpful. We hypothesised the involvement of SI defects.

The diagnosis of congenital diarrheal disorders like CSID is difficult due to unspecific symptoms and usually requires invasive biopsy sampling of the intestine. Sequencing of the SI gene and molecular analysis of the resulting potentially pathogenic SI protein variants may facilitate a diagnosis in the future. This study aimed to categorize SI mutations based on their functional consequences. Methods cDNAs encoding 13 SI mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. The molecular pathogenicity of the resulting SI mutants was defined by analyzing their biosynthesis, cellular localization, structure and enzymatic functions. Results Three biosynthetic phenotypes for the novel SI mutations were identified. The first biosynthetic phenotype was defined by mutants that are intracellularly transported in a fashion similar to wild type SI and with normal, but varying, levels of enzymatic activity. The second biosynthetic phenotype was defined by mutants with delayed maturation and trafficking kinetics and reduced activity. The third group of mutants is entirely transport incompetent and functionally inactive. Conclusions The current study unraveled CSID as a multifaceted malabsorption disorder that comprises three major classes of functional and trafficking mutants of SI and established a gradient of mild to severe functional deficits in the enzymatic functions of the enzyme. General significance This novel concept and the existence of mild consequences in a number of SI mutants strongly propose that CSID is an underdiagnosed and a more common intestinal disease than currently known.},

The analysis focused on recessive model including compound heterozygous mutations. Sanger sequencing was used to validate identified mutations and to screen the patient's newborn sister and grandparents. Expression and localization analysis were performed in the patient's duodenal biopsies using immunohistochemistry. Results: Using WES we identified a new compound heterozygote mutation in sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene; a maternal inherited known V577G mutation, and a novel paternal inherited C1531W mutation. Importantly, the newborn offspring carried similar compound heterozygous mutations. Computational predictions suggest that both mutations highly destabilize the protein. SI expression and localization studies determined that the mutated SI protein was not expressed on the brush border membrane in the patient's duodenal biopsies, verifying the diagnosis of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). Conclusions: The novel compound heterozygote V577G/C1531W SI mutations lead to lack of SI expression in the duodenal brush border, confirming the diagnosis of CSID. These cases of CSID extend the molecular spectrum of this condition, further directing a more adequate dietary intervention for the patient and newborn sibling.},

  abstract = {Objective IBS is a common gut disorder of uncertain pathogenesis. Among other factors, genetics and certain foods are proposed to contribute. Congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a rare genetic form of disaccharide malabsorption characterised by diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating, which are features common to IBS. We tested sucrase\textendash isomaltase (SI) gene variants for their potential relevance in IBS. Design We sequenced SI exons in seven familial cases, and screened four CSID mutations (p.Val557Gly, p.Gly1073Asp, p.Arg1124Ter and p.Phe1745Cys) and a common SI coding polymorphism (p.Val15Phe) in a multicentre cohort of 1887 cases and controls. We studied the effect of the 15Val to 15Phe substitution on SI function in vitro. We analysed p.Val15Phe genotype in relation to IBS status, stool frequency and faecal microbiota composition in 250 individuals from the general population. Results CSID mutations were more common in patients than asymptomatic controls (p=0.074; OR=1.84) and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference sequenced individuals (p=0.020; OR=1.57). 15Phe was detected in 6/7 sequenced familial cases, and increased IBS risk in case\textendash control and population-based cohorts, with best evidence for diarrhoea phenotypes (combined p=0.00012; OR=1.36). In the population-based sample, 15Phe allele dosage correlated with stool frequency (p=0.026) and Parabacteroides faecal microbiota abundance (p=0.0024). The SI protein with 15Phe exhibited 35\% reduced enzymatic activity in vitro compared with 15Val (p{$<$}0.05). Conclusions SI gene variants coding for disaccharidases with defective or reduced enzymatic activity predispose to IBS. This may help the identification of individuals at risk, and contribute to personalising treatment options in a subset of patients.},

Interestingly, the main symptoms of CSID overlap with those in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional gastrointestinal disorder with unknown etiology. Recent advances in genetic screening of IBS patients have revealed rare SI gene variants that are associated with IBS. Here, we investigated the biochemical, cellular and functional phenotypes of several of these variants. The data demonstrate that the SI mutants can be categorized into three groups including immature, mature but slowly transported, and finally mature and properly transported but with reduced enzymatic activity. We also identified SI mutant phenotypes that are deficient but generally not as severe as those characterized in CSID patients. The variable effects on the trafficking and function of the mutations analyzed in this study support the view that both CSID and IBS are heterogeneous disorders, the severity of which is likely related to the biochemical phenotypes of the SI mutants as well as the environment and diet of patients. Our study underlines the necessity to screen for SI mutations in IBS patients and to consider enzyme replacement therapy as an appropriate therapy as in CSID.},

SI, together with maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM), belongs to the enzyme family of disaccharidases required for breakdown of {$\alpha$}-glycosidic linkages in the small intestine. The effects of homozygote and compound heterozygote inheritance trait of SI mutations in CSID patients have been well described in former studies. Here we propose the inclusion of heterozygote mutation carriers as a new entity in CSID, possibly presenting with milder symptoms. The hypothesis is supported by recent observations of heterozygote mutation carriers among patients suffering from CSID or patients diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Recent studies implicate significant phenotypic heterogeneity depending on the character of the mutation and call for more research regarding the correlation of genetics, function at the cellular and molecular level and clinical presentation. The increased importance of SI gene variants in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other functional gastrointestinal disorders FGIDs and their available symptom relief diets like fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols FODMAPs suggest that the heterozygote mutants may affect the disease development and treatment.},

  abstract = {Protein interactions are key in vital biological processes. In many cases, particularly in regulation, this interaction is between a protein and a shorter peptide fragment. Such peptides are often part of larger disordered regions in other proteins. The flexible nature of peptides enables the rapid yet specific regulation of important functions in cells, such as their life cycle. Consequently, knowledge of the molecular details of peptide-protein interactions is crucial for understanding and altering their function, and many specialized computational methods have been developed to study them. The recent release of AlphaFold and AlphaFold-Multimer has led to a leap in accuracy for the computational modeling of proteins. In this study, the ability of AlphaFold to predict which peptides and proteins interact, as well as its accuracy in modeling the resulting interaction complexes, are benchmarked against established methods. We find that AlphaFold-Multimer predicts the structure of peptide-protein complexes with acceptable or better quality (DockQ {$\geq$}0.23) for 66 of the 112 complexes investigated\textemdash 25 of which were high quality (DockQ {$\geq$}0.8). This is a massive improvement on previous methods with 23 or 47 acceptable models and only four or eight high quality models, when using energy-based docking or interaction templates, respectively. In addition, AlphaFold-Multimer can be used to predict whether a peptide and a protein will interact. At 1\% false positives, AlphaFold-Multimer found 26\% of the possible interactions with a precision of 85\%, the best among the methods benchmarked. However, the most interesting result is the possibility of improving AlphaFold by randomly perturbing the neural network weights to force the network to sample more of the conformational space. This increases the number of acceptable models from 66 to 75 and improves the median DockQ from 0.47 to 0.55 (17\%) for first ranked models. The best possible DockQ improves from 0.58 to 0.72 (24\%), indicating that selecting the best possible model is still a challenge. This scheme of generating more structures with AlphaFold should be generally useful for many applications involving multiple states, flexible regions, and disorder.},

  abstract = {Background: Congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency is a rare hereditary cause of chronic diarrhea in children. People with this condition lack the intestinal brush-border enzyme required for digestion of di- and oligosaccharides, including sucrose and isomaltose, leading to malabsorption. Although the condition is known to be highly prevalent (about 5\%\textendash 10\%) in several Inuit populations, the genetic basis for this has not been described. We sought to identify a common mutation for congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency in the Inuit population. Methods: We sequenced the sucrase\textendash isomaltase gene, SI, in a single Inuit proband with congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency who had severe fermentative diarrhea and failure to thrive. We then genotyped a further 128 anonymized Inuit controls from a variety of locales in the Canadian Arctic to assess for a possible founder effect. Results: In the proband, we identified a novel, homozygous frameshift mutation, c.273\_274delAG (p.Gly92Leufs*8), predicted to result in complete absence of a functional protein product. This change was very common among the Inuit controls, with an observed allele frequency of 17.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 12.6\%\textendash 21.8\%). The predicted Hardy\textendash Weinberg prevalence of congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency in Inuit people, based on this single founder allele, is 3.0\% (95\% CI 1.4\%\textendash 4.5\%), which is comparable with previous estimates. Interpretation: We found a common mutation, SI c.273\_274delAG, to be responsible for the high prevalence of congenital sucrase\textendash isomaltase deficiency among Inuit people. Targeted mutation testing for this allele should afford a simple and minimally invasive means of diagnosing this condition in Inuit patients with chronic diarrhea.},

  abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, of which over 2000 have been reported to date. Mutations have yet to be analyzed in aggregate to assess their distribution across the tertiary structure of the CFTR protein, an approach that could provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationship of CFTR. In addition, the binding site of Class I correctors (VX-809, VX-661, and C18) is not well understood. In this study, exonic CFTR mutations and mutant allele frequencies described in 3 curated databases (ABCMdb, CFTR1, and CFTR2, comprising {$>$}130 000 data points) were mapped to 2 different structural models: a homology model of full-length CFTR protein in the open-channel state, and a cryo-electron microscopy core-structure of CFTR in the closed-channel state. Accordingly, residue positions of 6 high-frequency mutant CFTR alleles were found to spatially co-localize in CFTR protein, and a significant cluster was identified at the NBD1:ICL4 interdomain interface. In addition, immunoblotting confirmed the approximate binding site of Class I correctors, demonstrating that these small molecules act via a similar mechanism in vitro, and in silico molecular docking generated binding poses for their complex with the cryo-electron microscopy structure to suggest the putative corrector binding site is a multi-domain pocket near residues F374-L375. These results confirm the significance of interdomain interfaces as susceptible to disruptive mutation, and identify a putative corrector binding site. The structural pharmacogenomics approach of mapping mutation databases to protein models shows promise for facilitating drug discovery and personalized medicine for monogenetic diseases.},

  abstract = {A crucial component in structure-based drug discovery is the availability of highquality three-dimensional structures of the protein target. Whenever experimental structures were not available, homology modeling has been, so far, the method of choice. Recently, AlphaFold (AF), an artificial-intelligence-based protein structure prediction method, has shown impressive results in terms of model accuracy. This outstanding success prompted us to evaluate how accurate AF models are from the perspective of docking-based drug discovery. We compared the high-throughput docking (HTD) performance of AF models with their corresponding experimental PDB structures using a benchmark set of 22 targets. The AF models showed consistently worse performance using four docking programs and two consensus techniques. Although AlphaFold shows a remarkable ability to predict protein architecture, this might not be enough to guarantee that AF models can be reliably used for HTD, and post-modeling refinement strategies might be key to increase the chances of success.},

While the prevalence of CSID is high in the indigenous populations of Alaska and Greenland, it is imprecise and ambiguous in the Turkish pediatric population. In this cross-sectional case\textendash control study, which is retrospective in nature, next-generation sequencing (NGS) results obtained from records of 94 pediatric patients with chronic nonspecific diarrhea were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and treatment responses of those diagnosed with CSID were evaluated. We identified one new, homozygous frame-shift mutation and 10 other heterozygous mutations. Two cases were from the same family and nine were from different families. While the median age at onset of symptoms was 6 months (0\textendash 12), median age at diagnosis was 60 months (18\textendash 192) with a median delay of 5 years and 5 months (10 months -15 years and 5 months) in diagnosis. Clinical symptoms included diarrhea (100\%), abdominal pain (54.5\%), vomiting after consuming sucrose (27.2\%), diaper dermatitis (36.3\%) and growth retardation (81\%). Our clinical study revealed that sucrase-isomaltase deficiency may have been underdiagnosed in patients with chronic diarrhea in Turkey. In addition, the frequency of heterozygous mutation carriers was significantly higher than that of homozygous mutation carriers and those with a heterozygous mutations responded well to the treatment.},

  abstract = {Summary~           Colonic bacterial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) plays an important role in the salvage of unabsorbed carbohydrate and in colonic absorption of electrolytes and water. The objective of this study was to determine whether patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (DP-IBS) have a different pattern and rate of fermentation of carbohydrate and fiber to SCFA compared with controls. Fecal homogenates from 10 patients with DP-IBS and 10 age-matched controls were studied. SCFA were measured by gas chromatography in baseline fecal samples and in fecal homogenates in an in vitro anaerobic fermentation system after incubation with no additional substrate, lactulose, potato starch, citrus pectin, and hemicellulose over a 24-hour period. Net SCFA production rates were calculated for the first 6 h of the incubation period. Patients with DP-IBS had a consistently different pattern of less total SCFA, a lower percentage of acetate (p {$<$} 0.05), and a higher proportion of n-butyrate (p {$<$} 0.05) than controls. In stool homogenates from both controls and DP-IBS patients, lactulose fermentation resulted in the highest rate of SCFA production followed by pectin, starch, and hemicellulose. However, at all time points, the fecal homogenates from controls generated a higher concentration of total SCFA, acetate, and propionate with all substrates tested. SCFA production rates were higher in controls incubated with lactulose, starch, and hemicellulose. The fecal SCFA profile of patients with DP-IBS is characterized by lower concentrations of total SCFA, acetate, and propionate and a higher concentration and percentage of n-butyrate. Fecal flora from these patients produced less SCFA in an in vitro fermentation system in response to incubations with various carbohydrates and fibers. Differences in SCFA production by colonic bacterial flora in patients with DP-IBS may be related to the development of gastrointestinal symptoms.},

The first study consisted of data on 399 persons (339 whites, 53 blacks, and 7 American Indians) ages 1 month to 93 years, with normal intestinal histology. Among whites, all 117 children 5 years old or under had high lactase levels, whereas low levels were found only in subjects over 5 years of age. No low lactase levels were identified among the 11 black children 3 years old or under, but in comparison to coetaneous white children, their mean lactase activity was signficantly less. The majority of older blacks had low lactases. In whites and blacks alpha-disaccharidases did not participate in the age-related changes demonstrated with lactase. Of the 7 American Indians, none under 26 months old had low lactase levels, whereas the 4 over 10 years old had low activities. Heterozygotes for sucrase-isomaltase deficiency were identified only among whites. Low lactase levels developed during childhood in all races studied, however, many for unknown reasons maintained their lactose tolerance until adulthood. In the second study of 13 additional children with secondary disaccharidase deficiencies, emergence of a primary low lactase was related to age and race, rather than to mucosal damage. It appears that primary low intestinal lactase levels are absent or rare in whites under 5 and blacks under 3 years of age, and the deficiency is not related to mucosal damage.},

Here we explore the use of the recently developed deep learning method, AlphaFold, to predict structures of protein complexes from sequence. With a benchmark of 152 diverse heterodimeric protein complexes, multiple implementations and parameters of AlphaFold were tested for accuracy. Remarkably, many cases (43\%) had near-native models (medium or high critical assessment of predicted interactions accuracy) generated as top-ranked predictions by AlphaFold, greatly surpassing the performance of unbound protein\textendash protein docking (9\% success rate for near-native top-ranked models), however AlphaFold modeling of antibody\textendash antigen complexes within our set was unsuccessful. We identified sequence and structural features associated with lack of AlphaFold success, and we also investigated the impact of multiple sequence alignment input. Benchmarking of a multimer-optimized version of AlphaFold (AlphaFold-Multimer) with a set of recently released antibody\textendash antigen structures confirmed a low rate of success for antibody\textendash antigen complexes (11\% success), and we found that T cell receptor\textendash antigen complexes are likewise not accurately modeled by that algorithm, showing that adaptive immune recognition poses a challenge for the current AlphaFold algorithm and model. Overall, our study demonstrates that end-to-end deep learning can accurately model many transient protein complexes, and highlights areas of improvement for future developments to reliably model any protein\textendash protein interaction of interest.},
